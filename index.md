## Introduction

In Azure Machine Learning, data scientists can run experiments based on scripts that process data, train machine learning models, and perform other data science tasks. The runtime context for each experiment run consists of two elements:

a. The environment for the script, which includes all packages on which the script depends
b. The compute target on which the environment will be deployed and the script run.

In this article we will discuss how to create and use environment and compute target in Azure.
